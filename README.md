# Structured Epidemic Modeling

In our forthcoming preprint *An Algebraic Framework for Structured Epidemic Modeling*, we present an approach to scientific modeling, grounded in applied category theory, in which the high-level structure of a model is visible and manipulable in its software implementation. Here we reproduce and expand on the presented examples.
