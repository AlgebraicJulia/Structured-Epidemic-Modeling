# Structured Epidemic Modeling

In our preprint [An Algebraic Framework for Structured Epidemic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16345), we present an approach to scientific modeling, grounded in applied category theory, in which the high-level structure of a model is visible and manipulable in its software implementation. Here we reproduce and expand on the presented examples.
