# Petri Net Parameter Estimation with AlgebraicPetri and Catalyst

In order to run this parameter estimation example, first initialize the julia
environment by running:
```bash
julia --project init_env.jl
```
Then execute the example by running:
```bash
julia --project param_est.jl
```

This file will generate the figures included in the Royal Society paper, as
well as a visualization of the data.
